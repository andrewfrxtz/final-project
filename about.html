    <h2>Welcome to my About Me page!</h2>

    <p>Hi, I'm Andrew! This is me! On this page, I will detail a little about my personal life and my interests.</p>
    <p>I'm a born and raised Michigander, growing up just outside of Saginaw. I went to public school for the first few years of my primary education, and then was homeschooled for a few years before returning to traditional school. From then on, I went to parochial school, starting there in 6th grade. I eventually went to Valley Lutheran High School, starting there in 2016. It was in 2017 that I got my first job, a food-service position at the McDonald's near my house. That was a very interesting first job, to say the least. I got a lot of experience in customer service, cash handling, and inventory, and made connections with people I still talk to regularly. I worked that job until I left for college, after graduating from VLHS in 2019.</p>
    <p>In the fall of 2019, I started my first semester here at MSU. I was a chemical engineering major when I started my first class here, but very quickly realized that I did not like chemistry or engineering. I was minoring in Spanish at the time, and was taking a phonetics class, igniting my interest in linguistics. I made the change, and started my first class in the spring of 2020, and loved it! However, since it was the spring of 2020, life was turned upside down for a long time. I left MSU's campus to go home, and wouldn't be back for over a year. </p>
    <p>After studying linguistics for two semesters, I realized that I wanted to do more with artifical intelligence and their language skills, so I decided to minor in computer science. It was then that my enjoyment of programming was formed, and I decided to double major in computer science and linguistics together. After moving back to East Lansing in 2021, it was evident that I liked programming, not computer science. I dropped computer science the following spring, but still wanted to work in the technology field. I then got a job with an access management team, and finally found my specialization. I've been working on their team for over a year and a half, and I've loved it!</p>
    <p>I have plenty of interests pertaining to my career, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Learning programming languages</li>
        <li>Developing cybersecurity practices</li>
        <li>Earning IT certifications</li>
        <li>Developing access management processes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I do also like to spend my free time doing non-career building activities! Some of these include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cross-stitching</li>
        <li>Movies (I'll watch almost anything!)</li>
        <li>Card and board games</li>
    </ul>
